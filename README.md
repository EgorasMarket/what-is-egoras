# What Is Egoras

Egoras is a smart contract-based re-commerce/resale marketplace that allows sellers and buyers of used items to exchange value quickly without any third party that can look over or manipulate transactions. Egoras combines concepts from re-commerce with lessons learned from building cryptocurrencies. An important key to inspiring participation in any marketplace, currency or free-market economy is a fair accounting system that consistently reflects each personâ€™s contribution. Egoras attempts to accurately and transparently reward an unbounded number of individuals who creates value in its marketplace.
